## Setting up
When I was in the stages of deciding and confirming my tool. The first step I needed to complete was to set it up. The tool I would be trying is [Kaboomjs](https://kaboomjs.com/). There are many different ways to set up Kaboom but the reccomended way on the tool list is to set it up with the cdn. The cdn is basically just a link that you paste into a file and allows you to use that specific tool. The cdn had to be pasted into a .html file so what I did was go to the sandbox folder, create the kaboom folder, and create a index.html file to paste the cdn in there. After pasting the cdn in there it should give you a checkered screen and it did which means I now have set up Kaboom and can utilize it.

## Tinkering
At first I tinkered mostly on the [playground](https://kaboomjs.com/play?example=add) on Kabooms website. This playground gave you a selection of component that Kaboom utilizes and has a premade template of it being put into action. The components that I tinkered with include the Gravity and A.I. component.I also tinkered with the Kaboom Playground, it lets you choose different elements and components and gives you basic code that uses that specific element/component which you can change. I played around with the gravity component by changing the value of gravity which is a value that changes the rate an object moves in by pixels pers second. I also tinkered by changing the key to jump instead of having space as the key I changed it to **W** Another thing I tinkered with is an A.I element where you have an enemy that follows you and shoots you every so often which would kill you. I tinkered by changing some values and aspects of the entity making it faster and the bullets it shoots more accurate making it smarter and stronger.

## Actual Tinkering
At the start, I really only just looked at the script in the Kaboom playground. I had a reason for this, it was because the [tutorial](https://kaboomjs.com/doc/intro) that was given gave us some code to start with. What the code did was load in a sprite. From what I had thought, I thought the sprite "bean" was part of Kaboom like a framework meaning you just have to write the code and it already exists without you creating it. This stopped me from doing anything for a few days and I really never just tried finding a solution. The most I did was ask my friend but he didn't know either. I started thinking about how if I was going to confirm this tool I should at least finish the tutorial and get a basic understanding of it. I finally realized that I actually had to create my own .png file and put it into the Kaboom folder. It took a long time but I finally got results and I was seeing what you're supposed to get from the tutorial. I pasted code it gave you and it modified the sprite and I also tinkered by modifying it further. The point I stopped at was where the sprite would be given an actual physical body, the code for some reason did not work as there was no sprite that was added and this sprite is supposed to be able to jump but nothing appeared.

## Engineering Design Process
Just like how I didn't know I actually had to insert my own image as a sprite for the tutorial. The next stage of me learning Kaboom is to find out why another part of the tutorial isn't working and finish the tutorial as a whole. After finishing the tutorial I want to look at the components Kaboom gives you and test them all out like the Kaboom playground but I'm going to be the one making the code.

## Skills
## * I've learned that if something doesn't work, don't just give up on it. I may try things once or twice and if it doesn't work move on as repeating the same action over and over again with the same results is insanity. But when coding there is always a solution and the code doesn't work because you're the one making the mistake like when I thought the sprite **Bean** was given from just setting up Kaboom but I had to create the sprite.
## * Don't just read, modify. When tinkering you shouldn't just read a tutorial or watch a video. When I was doing the first few parts of the tutorial I pasted in the code and it would give you something. I tried out the functions of the code by changing certain values changing how it works like how I made the A.I. enemy stronger.
